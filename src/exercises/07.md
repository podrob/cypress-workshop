# Exercise 7 - Date Fields

We will continue on our happy path journey through to the final page of the goose sighting serivce. 


 ### Exercise

Expand our `journey_test.spec.js` to continue by entering valid dates in the 'Date Saw Goose' page before continuing through the confirmation page.


If a site uses \<input type="date"> for date pickers then Cypress allows you to fill the date as one call to `cy.type('yyyy-mm-dd')`. Further info in the docs: https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type.html#Date-Inputs  

In this example, the GDS Date input component has been correctly implemented to use three text fields. Using your existing knowledge, populate these fields with a valid date entry. 

Interact with the 'Continue' button to progress our journey. Once you have moved onto the 'check your answers' summary page, continue once more to progress to the final page of the service.
