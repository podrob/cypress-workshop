# Exercise 9 - Introducing Cypress Testing Library 

Now we have learned about Cypress we're going to make use of an additional library called the `Cypress Testing Library` (https://testing-library.com/docs/cypress-testing-library/intro).

The library is based upon the DOM testing library which encourages tests that avoid implementation detail, instead focussing on the system from the user's perspective. 

Let's refactor our existing tests to closer mimic our service being used as a user would, giving us confidence the journey can be completed.

 ### Exercise

This current project already has the Cypress Testing Library installed via our 'package.json'.

Our service under test currently has one button per screen which means we can easily identify the element by it's class. However, this is an implementation detail which can increase in complexity as the number of elements on screen increases.

Instead of searching for elements via their DOM ids or classes, let's try and find the 'Start now' link on the first screen of our journey as the user would.

Amend our `journey_test.spec.js` and replace the initial click of the 'Start now' link to the following Cypress Testing Library implementation:

```javascript
cy.findByText('Start now').click();
```

### Conclusion 

Our test now identifies this link via the UI that the user sees. Not only does this validate the content of the button/link visible to the user, but it also makes our tests more readable.
