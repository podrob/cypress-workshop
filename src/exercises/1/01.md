# Exercise 1 - Initial run of Cypress

### Opening the Cypress runner

You'll notice we have a script in our `package.json` to open the Cypress test runner.

When running this for the first time a new 'cypress' folder will be created at the root of your project containing examples in the 'integration' folder. 

Cypress will also open the test runner, try it yourself by running following:

```sh 
$ npm run cy:open
```

 ### Exercise

 From within the Cypress test runner, run the `actions.spec.js` automated tests by clicking on them. 

 > The default examples provided are created to run on a demo 'Kitchen Sink' web application created by the Cypress team `https://example.cypress.io`

 Cypress automatically detects web browsers installed on your local system unlike Selenium which requires the manual management of web drivers.

 Once you have successfully seen the actions tests run, try running them again but this time on a different web browser.
