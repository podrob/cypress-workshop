# Exercise 1 - Initial run of Cypress

### Opening the Cypress runner

There is a script in our `package.json` file that I have created to open the Cypress test runner.

Try it now by running the following: 

```sh 
$ npm run cy:open
```

> The Cypress team have recently added Component Testing into the product, but is currently in beta mode.

At Pod Point we use Cypress for E2E (end to end) testing. Select this option in the Runner to proceed. The Runner will then outline the configurations that it has automatically generated within your workspace. 

Cypress will then detect any compatible web browsers on your machine to start testing with. (Chromium based browsers only)

Pick your browser of choice and continue.

You will be given the option to create a new empty spec (a test file) or have Cypress scaffold examples specs, select this option so we can play with some examples. 

Cypress has now added an 'e2e' directory in your workspace containing a collection of examples of Cypress in action

> Older versions of Cypress named this directory 'integration' but as this term was overloaded in the industry they have updated it to e2e to better reflect the Cypress primary use case.

Cypress will now open the 'Runner' in your browser of choice.

 ### Exercise

 From within the Cypress test runner, run the `actions.spec.js` automated tests by clicking on them. 

 > The default examples provided are created to run on a demo 'Kitchen Sink' web application created by the Cypress team `https://example.cypress.io`

The Command log outlines the actions taken by the running test (more on this later). 

The web application under test is displayed in an iFrame within the Runner.

### Task 
Once you have successfully seen the actions tests run, try running them again but this time on a different web browser.
