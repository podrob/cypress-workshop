# Exercise 2 - Creating your first test


### Where should you put your tests?

Cypress tests are located in the `integration` folder. 

Delete the `examples` folder that Cypress made for us and create a file named `journey_test.spec.js`. This will contain our service journey test.


 ### Exercise

Implement a Mocha style test in the newly created `journey_test.spec.js` file that asserts we can visit: `https://record-a-goose-sighting.herokuapp.com/steps/start`. 

The `cy` object is a built-in object in Cypress, and is used to call all the Cypress APIs.\*

\* Hint, we do this using the Cypress visit function.


### Conclusion 

Take a look at the Cypress runner following the successful implementation of a page visit.

Notice a few things:

- The command log shows a new VISIT action
- Our page is rendered in the right hand pane
- Cypress has automatically asserted we are able to visit the url
- The VISIT displays a blue pending state until the page finishes loading.
