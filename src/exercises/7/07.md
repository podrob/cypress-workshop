# Exercise 7 - Date Fields

We will continue on our happy path journey through to the final page of the goose sighting serivce. 


 ### Exercise

Expand our `journey_test.spec.js` to continue by entering valid dates in the 'Date Saw Goose' page before continuing through the confirmation page.


If a site uses \<input type="date"> for date pickers then Cypress allows you to fill the date as one call to `cy.type('yyyy-mm-dd')`. However in this example, the developer has implemented the date picker as seperate inputs (*facepalm). Frther info in the docs:
https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type.html#Date-Inputs 

Once you have moved onto the 'check your answers' summary page, continue once more to progress out happy path journey to the final page.
