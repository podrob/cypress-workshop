# Exercise 4 - Interacting with page elements

We will continue the happy path journey of our fake service by clicking on the 'Start now' link. 


 ### Exercise

In the Cypress test runner toggle on the `Open Selector Playground` via the icon that looks like a target. 

With the Playground Selector active, select the `Start now` link that is styled like a button.

You'll notice that the runner suggests you can interact with the element via `cy.get('.govuk-button')`. Click on the copy to clipboard button located 

In our `journey_test.spec.js` file paste this action after our visit command. 

We can interact with element by chaining Cypress functions. The `click` function can be called on our selected element:

`cy.get('.govuk-button').click();`

Take a moment to inspect the test runner, you are able to time travel through the test and see the state of the application at each step.
